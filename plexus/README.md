## THE PROBLEMS WE AIM TO SOLVE

### LACK OF AWARENESS
Pet owners, such as the ones in our country India, tend to not be aware
of services that exist for pets.

### INCONVENIENCE OF TRACK OF RECORDS
When it comes to maintaining hard copies of the medical history of pets,
information may be a pain to hold on to.

### INABILITY TO ACCESS SERVICES
It is usually not easy to identify and locate good centers offering services
for pets right away.

## CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO
The first and foremost challenge we faced was developing the database and choosing which database to use for the various pet services, not only developing and updating the database but also integrating it with the app so that we could access its data and display it to the user accurately. It was a challenge to make sure the database was correct and was providing data precisely.The second challenge was developing the front-end as well as the UI for the app. We knew we had to make an easy to work with framework for the user to use therefore we had to work hard on the front end part of it as much as we did the backend

## FUTURE GOALS

and notes, also options to book appointments for your
